So basiclly, I am going to just talk, get some water, snacks, and get comfy. This one is about my pets.
</h1>
<p><em> So I have a dog and two chickens. I have had fish, 4 other chickens, one african grey, 2 cockatoes (I dont know how to spell) and 3 love birds. There were 2 when we got them but one layed an egg and boom. We gave away the fish, the fur chickens either died of age or soup. Our remaining two are 5-6 years old, making them like 3 years above the average life span. The birds mainly died of age, they lived pretty happy lives and we would let them roam around the house. My dog is 6 years old and is still alive, and those are my pets. I have no name for the chickens I just refer to their color, and my dog is called Dina. She is a blond terrier and is small.
<h2>Frisbee club</h2>
  <p><b>So I like frisbee. I know six ways to throw a frisbee and I am pretty good if I do say so myself. I like to throw and catch it myslef so that I practice my throws and my sprints. I play ultamite frisbee with my cross country team and I hope to carry my friends next year. I also want to work on endurance and speed so any type of running helps.</b></p>
